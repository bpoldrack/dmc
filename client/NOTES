Validator does not validate hidden fields. So it is (for example) safe to mark
hidden, dependent input fields as "required." On the flip side, however, this
means that once a tab is passed, it no longer affects validation. So if
checking for validity on Submit, it'll only be validating the visible (last)
tab.
