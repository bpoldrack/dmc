      <dt>How do you protect the privacy of my data?</dt>
      <dd>

      <p>We <strong>don't</strong>; <em>you</em> do!</p>

      <p><strong>Any data</strong> you enter into the survey form <strong>will
        be made public</strong>. If you are not comfortable with sharing your
        data, do not enter it.</p>

      <p>That being said, <strong>we do not ask you for any information that
        identifies you</strong>. You don't need an email or account to use
        this site, nor do we want any of that information from you. We don't use
        cookies or other means to track visitors. Using this website involves no
        3rd-party online services, no Google Analytics, no ads, nothing (take a
        look at the <a href="https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/dmc">code</a>,
        and see for yourself).</p>

      <p>We assign two <strong>random identifiers</strong> to a new submission.
        One for you to <strong>update</strong> your submission, and another one
        to <strong>access statistics</strong> computed based upon the
        submission. You should keep the first one to yourself, and share the
        latter one with anyone and everyone you desire.</p>

      <p>Remember, we do not track people. If you lose your access URL, we have
        no way of helping you recover it. <strong>Keep it safe!</strong></p>
      </dd>

      <dt>You said all data is public. Where is it?</dt>

      <dd>Data is kept in a <a href="https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/dmc_data">Git
          repository on Github</a>. It is pushed there in batches every few days.</dd>
